# About
Simple To-Do List application that allows you to manage your tasks efficiently. With Blok, you can 
easily add, update, and remove your to-dos. Let's get started!

# Features $ Using Guide
Home Page - List of Existing To-Dos:
On the home page, you'll find a list of all your existing to-dos with their titles and statuses.

# Adding a New To-Do:
To add a new to-do, simply type your task in the input box provided. Click the "Add" button to add 
the task to the list.

# Updating To-Do Status:
You can update the status of a to-do by clicking the "Update Status" button on the to-do card. It 
will toggle between "pending" and "completed."

# Removing To-Do:
If you want to remove a to-do, click the "Remove" button on the to-do card. It will be removed 
from the list.

# Todo Numbers
Each to-do is assigned a unique number, which is shown before its title. This number helps you keep 
track of your to-dos.

# Notes
To-dos will be displayed in the order they were added, with the latest to-do appearing at the bottom.
Empty to-do titles will not be added to the list.
The application currently uses a local state to store to-dos, so refreshing the page will clear the 
to-do list.
